/*Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), write a function that returns the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Input Format:
The input is given as a list representing the level-order traversal of the Binary Search Tree (BST).
Each element in the list represents a node's value, and the keyword null is used to indicate the absence of a node (i.e., a missing child).
Output Format:
The output is a single integer representing the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the BST.

Sample Input 1
[4,2,6,1,3]
Sample Output 1
1

Sample Input 2
[1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Sample Output 2
1*/
