/*You are given the number of nodes n in a binary tree, followed by two sequences of integers that represent the in-order and pre-order traversals of the tree. Your task is to:
Construct the binary tree from these two traversals.
Return (or print) the level-order traversal of the constructed tree.

Input Format:
An integer n, the number of nodes in the tree.
A line with n integers separated by spaces representing the in-order traversal.
A line with n integers separated by spaces representing the pre-order traversal.
Output Format:
The level-order traversal of the tree, printed as n space-separated integers.

Example
Input : 6
3 1 4 0 5 2
0 1 3 4 2 5
output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 */
